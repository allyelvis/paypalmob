create a basic structure for an API program to integrate a mobile money service with PayPal. 
However, please note that this is a complex task and involves several steps including user authentication, 
transaction handling, error handling, etc. 
Also, you'll need to use the APIs provided by both the mobile money service and PayPal.

Here's a simple Python example using Flask and the PayPal REST SDK:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from paypalrestsdk import Payment, configure

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure PayPal SDK
configure({
  "mode": "sandbox", # sandbox or live
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" })

@app.route('/pay', methods=['POST'])
def pay():
    # Extract payment details from mobile money service
    # This part depends on the mobile money service you are using
    payment_details = request.get_json()

    # Create a new PayPal payment
    payment = Payment({
        "intent": "sale",
        "payer": {
            "payment_method": "paypal"},
        "transactions": [{
            "amount": {
                "total": payment_details['amount'],
                "currency": payment_details['currency']},
            "description": payment_details['description']}],
        "redirect_urls":{
            "return_url":"http://localhost:5000/payment/execute",
            "cancel_url":"http://localhost:5000/payment/cancel"}})

    # Create payment on PayPal
    if payment.create():
        print('Payment created successfully')
    else:
        print(payment.error)

    return 'OK'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This is a very basic example and doesn't include error handling, user authentication, etc. You'll need to replace `"YOUR_CLIENT_ID"` and `"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"` with your actual PayPal app credentials. Also, you'll need to implement the mobile money service part according to their API.

Please note that handling payments is a sensitive operation and should be done following all security best practices. It's recommended to have a deep understanding of both PayPal and the mobile money service APIs and their security guidelines before implementing such a system. Also, consider consulting with a professional developer or a security expert. 

This code is for educational purposes only and should not be used in production without proper security measures.
